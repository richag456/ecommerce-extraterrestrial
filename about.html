								<!-- <h3>Dolore Amet Consequat</h3> -->
								<p>Extraterrestrial is here to simplify your interplanetary excursions. With so many spaceports, destinations, and the sheer amount of options and information that comes along with space travel, planning an out of this world trip can be stressful and confusing. Our goal is to uncomplicate your desires and needs and to help you enjoy the beauty of space burden-free.</p>
								<!--<p>The vision for this website is for it to serve as a centralized hub where any passenger from anywhere in the world can come for any space-travel related service. From checking departures/arrivals, buying tickets, and looking up spaceport information to leaving passenger reviews, comparing pricings amongst different spacelines, and reserving lodging for after the flight, a passenger should be able to do anything and everything they would ever need to here on Extraterrestrial.</p>-->

								<h4>A quick note from the Founder and CEO, John Doe</h4>
								<p>Extraterrerstrial has come a long way and has allowed hundreds of millions worldwide to satisfy their space-travel related needs. So I figured a short letter that reflects on our values would be appropriate. In the early stages of Extraterrestrial, back in the conception stage, I had this strong belief that the vastness and wonder of space is something that every person should experience first hand. So my team and I worked to create something that was committed to enabling as many people as possible to do so. Whether it be through easy access to reliable information, allowing customers to find the best and lowest prices, or simply providing a clean, convenient user interface, we try to 
								   make things simple and easy. Our solar system can certainly be a complicated place. Let us show you it can also be stunningly simple.</p>
